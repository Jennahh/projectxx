<h1 style = "text-align: center;"> One in Seven California Students Must Get <br> a COVID-19 Vaccine Before the State Deadline </h1>
<p style= "text-align: center;">By Jennah Haque, Melissa Newcomb, and Caroline Ghisolfi</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">More than 40 California districts are enforcing COVID-19 vaccine requirements ahead of next year’s <br> state mandate. And some are stricter than Gov. Gavin Newsom’s plans, according to an <br> investigation by the Peninsula Press. </p>

<p style="text-align:center;">No California agency, including the California Department of Education, is keeping track of <br> these policies. The Peninsula Press contacted all 942 public school districts to create the first <br> living database recording the state patchwork of COVID-19 requirements. </p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> Information collected from over 650 school districts reveals that over one million students are <br>affected by a wide range of vaccine policies. Some apply only to new employees, athletes or <br>children attending overnight school trips. Others affect the entire school population.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">Just under 300 districts couldn’t be reached for comment after several attempts to contact<br>district superintendents, board members and administrative staff via email and phone. Ten <br> districts refused to release information about their COVID-19 vaccine requirements. </p>

<p style="text-align:center;">San Diego Unified, Los Angeles Unified and five other districts with over 20,000 students <br> approved mandates for students, staff or both. Like these districts, over 80 percent of those <br> enforcing independent policies lean Democratic. Only 7 districts with independent mandates <br> lean Republican, according to data provided by the California Secretary of State.  </p>

<p> This is a map of the state of California dividedup by public school district boundaries. Dots are in the center of each district polygon, where dot size encodes school district enrollment and dot color encodes independent mandate status. Several independent mandate districts are located in the greater regions of Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Fransisco. This comprises over 1 million students. </p>
